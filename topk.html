      <h2>
        Defining DP top-k selection<hr style="margin-top:3px">
      </h2>
      <p>Consider a dataset from users, where each user has a set of binary elements, where a value of 1 indicates the presence of the element. Moreover, we can define a "score" for every element, which denotes its importance in the dataset, as the sum of the values of the element for all the users.</p>
      <p>Below we an example of such dataset:</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-7">
          <img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardocarvalhods/ricardocarvalhods.github.io/master/images/dptopk1.svg" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br/>
      <p>Elements can be for example:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Symptoms</b>: a value of 1 indicates the existence of the symptom for that user/patient.</li>
        <li><b>Products</b>: a value of 1 indicates that the user purchased the product.</li>
        <li><b>Pages</b>: a value of 1 indicates that the user visited the page.</li>
        <li><b>Photos</b>: a value of 1 indicates that the user liked the photo</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    <p>The histogram we see above on the right is then showing the <b>score</b> of the elements (i.e. sum of each column).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>So a <b>top-k selection</b> is interested in the <b>most valuable</b> elements, i.e. the elements with the <b>highest scores</b>.</li>
      <li>For example, a top-3 selection in the example above (without considering privacy) would return $[F,C,G]$.</li>
      <li>Moreover, taking <b>privacy</b> into account, we want to select the top-k such that the result is not giving away the presence of elements of any specific user.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>
            There are a few options for DP selection mechanisms, with the <b>Exponential Mechanism (EM)</b> [<a href="#tooltip1" id="tooltip1" disabled data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Frank McSherry and Kunal Talwar. Mechanism design via differential privacy. In FOCS, volume 7, pages 94–103, 2007.">1</a>] being one of the most used.
            <ul>
              <li>Using EM, we select some element $i$ from a dataset $D$ with probability: $\Pr[EM(D)=i] \propto \exp(\frac{\varepsilon \cdot f(i,D)}{2\cdot \Delta f})$</li>
              <li>So in practice we have a <b>random selection</b> with a probability of selection for every element in the <b>full domain of elements</b> (i.e. all known/existing elements - the image above shows the full domain of the example).</li>
              <li>Moreover, the random <b>selection is biased towards elements with high score</b> (which is want we want), and we also have DP guaranteed (going into details of EM is out of scope now).</li>
              <li>To select k elements, we simply use EM iteratively, renormalizing probabilities and removing elements selected at every iteration.</li>
          </ul>

        Motivation: Efficiency of DP top-k selection<hr style="margin-top:3px">

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>
            Now consider a dataset with 1 million elements to select the top-10. How do we do this with DP?
            <ul>
              <li>As mentioned above we can apply EM 10 times</li>
              <ul>
                <li>This means normalizing probabilities of 1 million elements 10 times, and then also running a random selection 10 times.</li>
                <li>It easy to see that this iterative process is <b>not</b> practical for real-world systems, especially when the selection is part of a larger and more complex analysis pipeline.</li>                
              </ul>
              <li>There is an equivalent approach in the literature [<a href="#tooltip2" id="tooltip2" disabled data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="David Durfee and Ryan Rogers. Practical differentially private top-k selection with pay-what-you-get composition. In NeurIPS, pages 3527–3537, 2019.">2</a>] that is more efficient:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>It adds Gumbel noise once to all 1 million scores, then sorts the noisy score and returns the 10 elements with highest noisy scores.</li>
                <li>However, even this one-shot approach can still be time consuming for large datasets.</li>
                <li>In fact, we saw that, without considering the time to access the database, (i.e. only counting the time for the private top-k selection) this approach takes around <b>0.5 seconds</b> to do a <b>DP top-10</b> selection on a dataset with <b>one million elements</b>.</li>

          <p><b>Restricted domain</b> top-k mechanisms select k elements by choosing from the elements that have the top-$\bar{k}$ scores, for a chosen $\bar{k} \geq k$. The image on the right illustrates this setting.</p>          
          <ul>
            <li>This means only processing $\bar{k}$ elements, instead of the full domain (as it was with EM).</li>
            <li>This improves computational efficiency dramatically.</li>

            <b>What is the <b style="color:red">problem</b> with DP top-k selection on Restricted domain?</b><br/>
            <ul>
              <li>DP mechanisms working on restricted domain still need to provide DP guarantees for the <b>full domain</b> of all elements.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>That's because the restricted domain itself (i.e. the top-$\bar{k}$ elements) is <b>sensitive</b>.</li>
                <li>Therefore, simply enforcing DP on the restricted domain is <b>not</b> sufficient to guarantee privacy.</li>
                <li>Moreover, proving DP on the full domain when accessing only the restricted domain is a <b>really complex</b> task.</li>

            <li>In this context, the current approach is to start with a traditional DP top-k mechanism, and modify it such that it maintains the DP guarantee on the full domain while only selecting from the restricted domain.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The <b style="color:red">problem</b> with this approach is that you have to go through a <b>complex DP analysis</b> <u>for every DP top-k mechanism you want to use on restricted domain.</u></li>
                <li>This <b>limits the applicability</b> of restricted domain mechanisms, especially because new improved top-k mechanisms are being proposed every year.</li>

          <p>Our "framework" for differentially private top-k selection aims to be highly practical.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It takes <b>as a black-box</b> any given DP top-$k$ mechanism and automatically "converts" it into a <b>restricted domain</b> mechanism.</li>
            <li>The framework provides a <b>unified proof of privacy</b> "for free", which is already valid by default for any given mechanism.</li>
